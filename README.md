# GhostFi

A private-by-default banking interface on Solana, powered by the [Umbra SDK](https://sdk.umbraprivacy.com).

> Spend freely. Leave no trace.

---

## The Problem

Every transaction on Solana is publicly readable. Anyone can look up your wallet and see exactly what you hold and every transfer you've ever made. For personal finance, payroll, or business payments — this is unacceptable.

## The Solution

GhostFi gives you a banking interface where your balance is **private by default**. Powered by Umbra's privacy infrastructure:

- Encrypted balances via Arcium MPC
- Anonymous transfers via a UTXO mixer with Groth16 ZK proofs
- Selective compliance disclosure via viewing keys

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🔒 Private Balance | Shield USDC/USDT into an encrypted on-chain balance only you can see |
| 📤 Private Send | Send tokens via the GhostFi mixer — no on-chain link between sender and recipient |
| 📥 Receive | Scan for incoming UTXOs and claim them into your private balance |
| 📋 Compliance | Export your viewing key for selective disclosure to auditors or accountants |

## How it uses the Umbra SDK

| Action | SDK Function |
|---|---|
| Register account | `getUserRegistrationFunction` |
| Shield tokens | `getPublicBalanceToEncryptedBalanceDirectDepositorFunction` |
| Unshield tokens | `getEncryptedBalanceToPublicBalanceDirectWithdrawerFunction` |
| Private send (mixer) | `getPublicBalanceToReceiverClaimableUtxoCreatorFunction` |
| Scan incoming UTXOs | `getClaimableUtxoScannerFunction` |
| Claim UTXOs | `getReceiverClaimableUtxoToEncryptedBalanceClaimerFunction` |
